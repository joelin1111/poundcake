/**
 * Controller for roles
 *
 * This is a very basic controller to add/view/update/delete roles.
 * 
 * These tasks would typically be performed by a user with administrative level
 * permissions within Poundcake.
 * 
 * It's not likely that an admin would be managing Roles very often, since Roles
 * are pretty tightly coupled to the way ACLs work with Auth, and thus adding
 * a new role is likely to mean changes to the code to add/remove/change
 * permissions in some way.
 *
 * Developed against CakePHP 2.2.3 and PHP 5.4.4.
